# Deepfake detection system for MSc Thesis project
Focus of the thesis was to find the best subset of test sequences of images, based on custom metric of "sequence dynamic", to improve quality of predictions for any given Deepfake classification model.  
Project is currently undergoing major refactoring and doesn't contain notebooks used in final analysis.
